## Overview

We aspire to supply patients with larynx or vocal cord conditions an easy and intuitive way to communicate.
The system identifies the userâ€™s lip movements by video, and transforms the video to audio output of the spoken word. The system works on any computer equipped with a basic camera.
The system is based on image-processing algorithms and machine learning.
Given a video segment, the image-processing algorithm identifies the lips and extracts the coordinates of a number of points on the lips from each frame.
This data goes through a series of normalization actions to improve the classification results.
The last stage of the classification is performed by Machine Learning algorithms implemented by third-party packages we use.
After classifying a given word, the audio output of the result is played.
